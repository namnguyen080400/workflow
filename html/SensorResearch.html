                There are several of sensors use in both android and iphone. Those sensor are include accelerometer, Air Humidity Sensors,
                Ambient Light Sensors, Barcode / QR Code Sensors, Barometer, Fingerprint Sensors, GPS, Gyroscope, Hall Sensor,
                Magnetometer, Proximity Sensor, Thermometer, and Touchscreen Sensors.
                <br />
                <b>Accelerometer:</b> The sensor use for detect the smartphone orientation.
                <br />
                <b>Air Humidity Sensors:</b> Not a popular sensor, but the sensor measure humitity in air.
                <br />
                <b>Ambient Light Sensors:</b>The sensor automatically adjust brightness of the display.
                <br />
                <b>Barcode / QR Code Sensors:</b>  The sensor can read barcode on product packaging and QR codes.
                <br />
                <b>Barometer:</b> The sensor can measue air pressor for studying weather and altitude change.
                <br />
                <b>Fingerprint Sensors:</b> The sensor read and store biometric data from user fingers to unlock the phone.
                <br />
                <b>GPS:</b> The sensor helps to locate location on Earth and helps in navigation.
                <br />
                <b>Gyroscope:</b> The sensor can detect orientation, rotation and direction.
                <br />
                <b>Hall Sensor:</b> The sensor act like a compass in smartphone. It can detects magnetic field.
                <br />
                <b>Proximity Sensor:</b> The senor can detect distance of the phone from our skin or any other object.
                <br />
                <b>Thermometer:</b> The sensor can display the temperature of the device and environment.
                <br />
                <br />
                This sensors are useful for application because user rely on them in their daily life.

                The NFC is use for communticate between phone and other devices that support NFC. NFC can be found in smartphone,
                smartwatches, and some laptops. NFC in smartphone can you credit credit to make payment without using physical credit card.

                There are several of camera sensors that can be found in both android and iphone.
                This sensor is useful if users want to take a good picture.
                <br />
                <b>Macro sensor:</b> Allow to capture objects from close distance.
                <br />
                <b>Time of Flight (ToF) sensor:</b> Uses infrared light to determine depth information.
                <br />
                <b>Depth sensor:</b> The sensor helps to attain professional-style blur effects and better rendering of augmented reality effects.
                <br />
                <b>Telephoto sensor:</b> A sensor where you can zoom in phone camera.
                <br />
                <b>LiDAR sensor:</b> Use in iphone. The senor emits multiple signals which hits the subject and returns to the sensor.
                <br />
                <b>Ultra-Wide sensor</b>: The sensor provides a wide field of vision and it expands the smartphone cameraâ€™s view in a significant way.
                <br />
